## Do Now: Shady Shapes

How many 1x1 squares are in each figure?

**Extension**:
Count ALL of the squares in each of the figures (eg. 1x1 squares AND 2x2 squares, 3x3 squares, etc.)

## Mini whiteboards

Did anyone find a fast way to add up the number of squares?

*Hint: We can use our timestables...*

-------

### Learning Intention

Students will be able to Find the formula for the area of a rectangle. (VCMMG258).

### Success Criteria

ðŸŒ’ Level 1 - I can correctly solve 5 picture-based problems using the formula for the area of a rectangle. (Activity 1)
ðŸŒ“ Level 2 - I can correctly solve 5 word-based problems using the formula for the area of a rectangle. (Activity 2)
ðŸŒ• Level 3 - I can correctly solve 5 compound area problems using the formula for the area of a rectangle.

## Why do we need to know about area?

---

## Some skills that require area

- Estimating amount of paint to cover a wall
- Carpet laying
- Roofing
- Turfing
- Mulching a garden

Any other examples can you think of?

## Vocabulary

- *Dimension:* a measurement of a particular kind, such as width, or height.

- *Right-angle:*  an angle of 90Â°, as in a corner of a square.
- *Perpendicular:* At an angle of 90Â° to.
- *Perimeter:* the boundary of a closed geometrical figure. (1D)
- *Area:* the size of a surface. (2D)

## What is a rectangle





----

## Area of a Rectangle

$$
Area_{rectangle} = width \times height
$$



STEP 1 â€“ Write down formula
STEP 2 â€“ Substitute values and calculate area.
STEP 3 â€“ Show your units.
