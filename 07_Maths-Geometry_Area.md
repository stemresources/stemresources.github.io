## Do Now: Shady Shapes

How many 1x1 squares are in each figure?

**Extension**:
Count ALL of the squares in each of the figures (eg. 1x1 squares AND 2x2 squares, 3x3 squares, etc.)

## Mini whiteboards

Did anyone find a fast way to add up the number of squares?

*Hint: We can use our timestables...*

-------

## Vocabulary

- *Dimension:* a measurement of a particular kind, such as width, or height.

- *Right-angle:*  an angle of 90Â°, as in a corner of a square.
- *Perpendicular:* At an angle of 90Â° to.
- *Perimeter:* the boundary of a closed geometrical figure. (1D)
- *Area:* the size of a surface. (2D)

## What is a rectangle?





----

## Area of a Rectangle

$Area_{rectangle} = width \times height$

STEP 1 â€“ Write down formula
STEP 2 â€“ Substitute values and calculate area.
STEP 3 â€“ Show your units.

---

## Example


$$
\begin{align*}
Area_{rectangle} &= width \times height \\
 &= 10 cm \times 10 cm \\
 &= 100 cm^2
\end{align*}
$$
