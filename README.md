## A go-to resource for lesson plans

ðŸš€

Right now this is under construction. Cheers.

### Choosing an activity 

I have programmed a search bar to crawl my favourite maths resources, to limit time hunting through google.

<script async src="https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=3272051fa9ad652ee"></script>
<div class="gcse-search"></div>

The search currently indexes the following websites:

```markdown

https://au.ixl.com/math
